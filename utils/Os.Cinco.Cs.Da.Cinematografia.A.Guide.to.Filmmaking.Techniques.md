One of the main topics that Mascelli discusses in his book is the concept of cinematic time and space. He explains how the filmmaker can manipulate the perception of time and space through editing, camera movement, and sound. He also introduces the rules of composition, such as the rule of thirds, the golden ratio, and the balance of elements. He shows how to use these rules to create visual harmony and interest.
 
Another important topic that Mascelli covers is the use of close-ups and camera angles. He defines the different types of close-ups, such as extreme close-up, medium close-up, and long shot. He also explains the different types of camera angles, such as high angle, low angle, eye level, and oblique angle. He demonstrates how to use these techniques to reveal character emotions, create tension, and emphasize important details.
 
A final topic that Mascelli addresses is the principle of continuity. He defines continuity as the logical and smooth flow of action from one shot to another. He warns about the common mistakes that can break continuity, such as jump cuts, crossing the line, and mismatched eyelines. He also suggests some ways to maintain continuity, such as using match cuts, establishing shots, and screen direction.
