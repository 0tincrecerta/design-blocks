However, VMware Workstation 9 is not a free software. You need to purchase a license key to use it for more than 30 days. If you want to try it out for free, you can download a trial version from the official website[^1^]. But what if you want to use it for longer without paying? Is there a way to download VMware Workstation 9 in high compressed format?
 
The answer is yes, but you need to be careful. There are many websites that claim to offer free downloads of VMware Workstation 9 in high compressed format, but some of them may contain malware, viruses, or fake files that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. You should always check the source and reputation of the website before downloading anything from it.
 
One of the websites that seems to offer a legitimate download of VMware Workstation 9 in high compressed format is OpenSea[^3^]. This is a platform for digital collectibles and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that allows users to create, buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets. One of the collections on OpenSea is called "Free Download EXCLUSIVE Vmware Workstation 9 In High Compressed", which claims to provide a link to download the software for free.
 
To access the download link, you need to purchase one of the NFTs in the collection using Ethereum, a cryptocurrency. The price of each NFT varies from 0.01 ETH to 0.1 ETH, which is equivalent to about $40 to $400 at the time of writing. Once you buy an NFT, you will receive an email with the download link and instructions on how to install VMware Workstation 9 on your PC.
 
However, this method is not recommended for several reasons. First of all, buying an NFT does not guarantee that you will receive a valid download link or a working software. There is no way to verify the authenticity or quality of the file before downloading it. Second, buying an NFT involves paying a lot of fees and risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions. You may end up spending more money than buying a license key from VMware directly. Third, downloading and installing VMware Workstation 9 from an unknown source may violate the terms and conditions of VMware and expose your PC to security threats.
 
Therefore, the best way to download and install VMware Workstation 9 for free is to use the official trial version from VMware's website[^1^]. You can use it for 30 days without any limitations or restrictions. If you like it and want to continue using it after the trial period expires, you can purchase a license key from VMware or look for other alternatives such as VirtualBox[^2^], which is a free and open source virtualization software.
